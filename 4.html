<!-- ================= SUMMARY ================= -->
<section class="card">
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Project Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This project provides a comprehensive data‑driven analysis of road accidents in Egypt,
    focusing on injuries, fatalities, accident distribution, and emergency response capacity.
    By transforming raw accident data into interactive dashboards and analytical insights,
    the project highlights critical risk factors and supports informed decision‑making
    to improve road safety outcomes.

<!-- ================= KEY FINDINGS ================= -->
<section class="card">
  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <ul style="font-size:19px; line-height:1.9; padding-left:20px;">
    <li>
      Injuries and fatalities show an overall increasing trend, particularly among young
      and working‑age populations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Accident rates and dangerous roads are concentrated in specific governorates,
      indicating regional disparities in road safety.
    </li>
    <li>
      Passenger injuries represent the highest share of total injuries,
      highlighting the need for stronger in‑vehicle safety measures.
    </li>
    <li>
      Emergency service coverage does not always align with road risk levels,
      affecting response time and survival rates.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS ================= -->
<section class="card">
  <h2>Strategic Recommendations</h2>
  <ul style="font-size:19px; line-height:1.9; padding-left:20px;">
    <li>
      Implement targeted safety campaigns and stricter enforcement for high‑risk age groups
      and high‑traffic road segments.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prioritize infrastructure improvements and traffic control measures
      in governorates with the highest accident and injury rates.
    </li>
    <li>
      Strengthen passenger protection policies, including seatbelt enforcement
      and vehicle safety standards.
    </li>
    <li>
      Optimize ambulance and emergency service distribution based on road risk,
      population density, and accident severity.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= CONCLUSION ================= -->
<section class="card">
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The integration of data analytics, visualization, and strategic recommendations
    demonstrates the value of evidence‑based approaches in addressing road safety challenges.
    This project provides a scalable framework that can support policymakers,
    transportation authorities, and emergency services in reducing accidents,
    saving lives, and improving overall traffic safety in Egypt.
